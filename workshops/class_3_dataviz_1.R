# Class 3: Intro to ggplot2 in R
# Topic: Data Visualization 1
# Prof: Tim Fraser

# In today's workshop, we will learn how to code visualizations, using the ggplot2 package.

#############################################
### 1: Load Packages
#############################################

# Data viz and data manipulation packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# Data sources
library(gapminder) 

# Notes:

# a) SAVE YOUR SCRIPT.

# b) Always comment your code (what I'm doing now),

# c) use lots of spaces, and keep it clean.


#############################################
### 2: Gapminder data
#############################################

# Hans Rosling made a dataset that examines 
# change in life expectancy over time for 
# most countries in the world. 
# It is contained in the gapminder package.

# Let's view it. (see console below)
gapminder
# Each row is a country-year,
# marking the life expectancy, population, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
# Only can see some of it, right?


# Let's check out what vectors are in this dataframe, using the glimpse function.
# (Remember, a vector is a column in a spreadsheet;
# a data.frame is a spreadsheet.)
glimpse(gapminder)
# Nice, we can see things more concisely.

# Our data has six variables. Great!



#############################################
### 3: Your first scatterplot
#############################################

# Using the gapminder data
# map a series of vectors to become aesthetic features in the visualization (point, colors, fills, etc.)
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(
  # Let's make the x-axis gross-domestic product per capita (wealth per person)
  x = year, 
  # Let's make the y-axis country life expectancy
  y = lifeExp))

# Huh! We made an empty graph. Cool.

# That's because ggplot needs helper functions to add aesthetic features to the graph.
# For example, adding + geom_point() will overlay a scatterplot.

# Make a scatterplot
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + # same as above, except "+"
  geom_point()


# Learning Check 1:
# What kind of relationship does this graph show?
# Why might it matter to policymakers?




# Learning Check 2:
# What happens when you add the "alpha" below, and change its value?
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)

ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1)


# Learning Check 3:
# We can make it more visually appealing. 
# What happens when we do each of the following?

# If you want to make it a single color, 
# where do you need to write `color = ...`?

# If you want to make it multiple colors according to a vector, 
# where do you need to write `color = `?

# Version 1
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "steelblue")

# Version 2
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                                       color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)



#############################################
### 4. Improving our Visualizations
#############################################

# Learning Check 4:
# Let's make this visualization much more readable by adding labels
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                                       color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  # Add labels!
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (USD)", # label for x-values
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)", # label for y-values
       color = "Continent", # label for colors
       title = "Does Wealth affect Health?", # overall title
       subtitle = "Global Health Trends by Continent", # subtitle!
       caption = "Points display individual country-year observations.") # caption

# We can actually save visualizations as objects too, which can make things faster.
# Let's save our visual as 'myviz'
myviz <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                                                color = continent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "GDP per capita (USD)", 
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)",
       color = "Continent", 
       title = "Does Wealth affect Health?", # overall title
       subtitle = "Global Health Trends by Continent", # subtitle!
       caption = "Points display individual country-year observations.") # caption

# Now run myviz - what happens?
myviz


# Learning Check 5:
# We can do better, adding things onto our myviz object! Try changing themes. What happens below?

# Version theme_bw
myviz +
  # How about this theme?
  theme_bw()


# Version theme_dark
myviz +
  # How about this theme?
  theme_dark()

# Version theme_classic
myviz +
  # How about this theme?
  theme_classic()

# I personally really like the default theme or theme_bw.

### 5: Visualize diamonds data
#############################################

# Let's use the diamonds dataset, which comes with the ggplot2 package
# This is a dataset of over 50,000 diamond sales. 

diamonds

# We can use this visualization to check whether the 
# cut of diamonds really has any relationship with price.

glimpse(diamonds)

# Looks like the cut is an ordinal variable, while price is numeric.
# A boxplot might be helpful!

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, group = cut)) +
  # notice how we added group = cut, to tell it to use 5 different boxes, one per cut?
  geom_boxplot()

# Huh. How odd. 
# Looks like the cut of diamonds has very little impact 
# on what price they are sold at! 
# We can see lots of outliers at the top - really expensive diamonds for that cut.






# Learning Check 6: 
# Let's make this visualization more visually appealing.
# What changed in the code to make these two different visual effects?
# Hint: fill.
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, 
                                      group = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue")

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, 
                                      group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot()



# Learning Check 7:

# Sometimes, the names of categories won't fit well. We can try the following.
# What did we do?
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, 
                                      group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip()




# Learning Check 8:

# Sometimes, the legend doesn't fit well. We can try this.
# What happens when you change legend.position from 
# "right" to "bottom" to "left" to "top?

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price,
                                      group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price,
                                      group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, 
                                      group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "left")

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price, 
                                      group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

# 6: Visualizing Distributions
#############################################


# Different geom functions use colors in different ways, but this is a good example.

# For example, this is a histogram. 
# It visualizes the approximate distribution of a set of values.
# We can see how frequently diamonds are sold for certain prices versus others.
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, group = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") + # notice new function here
  labs(x = "Price (USD)",
       y = "Frequency of Price (Count)",
       title = "US Diamond Sales")



# Learning Check 9:

# Are most diamonds cheap or expensive?
# What type of distribution is this? 
# a) Normal?
# b) Uniform?
# c) Left Skewed?
# d) Right Skewed?


# Learning Check 10:

# Let's try a bar plot:
# What did we do in this code? Please describe in a paragraph.
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Cut of Diamonds over 0.25 carats", 
       y = "# of Diamonds")


#############################################
# 7: Breaking up a visual
#############################################

# Finally, we might want to break up our visual into multiple parts, using facet_wrap.

# Learning Check 11:

# What changed in the code below, and what did it result in?
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, fill = cut)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~cut) + # must be categorical variable
  labs(x = "Price (USD)",
       y = "Frequency of Price (Count)",
       title = "US Diamond Sales")

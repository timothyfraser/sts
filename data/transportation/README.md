# README `emissions.rds`

Explainer for the `emissions.rds` database file, sourced from Cornell's `catserver`, a county level database of emissions estimates for every county in the US, from 1990-2060.

## 3. Logic of a `catserver` query

This data was generated by the EPA's MOVES software, the gold standard for emissions estimation. Then, it was post-processed into a tidy format by the CAT team. Most codes in the database are derived from the [**MOVES id codes, available here.**](https://github.com/USEPA/EPA_MOVES_Model/blob/master/docs/MOVES4CheatsheetOnroad.pdf) Here's a brief description of the tables, columns, and their values.


### 3.1 identifiers

Every row has 3 main identifier fields, including `geoid`, `year`, `pollutant`, and `by`. See table below for definitions.

| field        |  type    |  meaning  | example                             |
|:---          |  :---:   | :---    |:---                                    |
| `geoid` | character | unique string identifier for each geographic area. | The US overall is `00` (2 characters). New York state is `36` (2 characters). Tompkins County, NY is `36109` (5 characters). |
| `year` | integer | unique 4-digit identifier for each year. | Currently, every 5 years from 1990 to 2060 are implemented (I think we skipped 1995 because MOVES couldn't do it (?)). |
| `pollutant` | integer | unique 2-3 digit identifier for each of ~19 supported pollutants. | `pollutant == 98` is CO2e, or Carbon Dioxide Equivalent, our main pollutant of interest. (Note: Steer clear of VOC; I think it's only partially accurate. Ask Tim for more details.) For the complete list of `ids` outputted by MOVES, see the [**MOVES Onroad Cheatsheet**](moves_cheatsheet_onroad.pdf). |
| `by` | integer | unique identifier for each level of disaggregation, specific to our CAT system. | This id includes [16, 8, 12, 14, and 15], and describes whether that row reflects a value overall (`by == 16`) or a value disaggregeated by a specific `sourcetype` (`by == 8`), a specific `fueltype` (`by == 14`), a specific `regclass`/regulatory class (`by == 12`), or a specific `roadtype` (`by == 15`). When `by == 16` (overall), the `sourcetype`, `regclass`, `fueltype`, and `roadtype` fields will all be `NA` (because it's overall, not disaggregated). |

### 3.3 disaggregation identifier

Every row has the special `by` identifier, which as mentioned above, shows the level of disaggregation in CAT formatted data. Here's a breakdown of currently supported `by` disaggregation levels.

| `by` value |  disaggregation    |  meaning                   | example                                                                 |
|:------------          |  :---:   | :---                       |   :---                                                                  |
| `16` | overall | emissions, vmt, etc. *overall*. | A row where `by == 16` shows the total onroad emissions, vmt, sourcehours, etc. for geographic area (`geoid`) in that `year`, overall. |
| `8` | by sourcetype | emissions, vmt, vehicles, etc. by type of vehicle. | Total CO2e emissions for passenger cars in Tompkins county in 2020 would be in the row where `by == 8`, `sourcetype == 21`, `year == 2020`,  `geoid == "36109"`, and `pollutant == 98`. |
| `12` | by regclass |  emissions, vmt, vehicles, etc. by regulatory class of vehicle. | So total CO2e emissions for light duty vehicles in Tompkins County in 2020 would be in the row where `by == 12`, `regclass == 20`, `year == 2020`, `geoid == "36109"`, and `pollutant == 98`. |
| `14` | by fueltype | emissions, vmt, vehicles etc. by type of fuel. | So total CO2e emissions from diesel vehicles in Tompkins County in 2020 would be in the row where `by == 14`, `fueltype == 2`, `year == 2020`,  `geoid == "36109"`, and `pollutant == 98`. |
| `15` | by roadtype | emissions and vmt by type of road. | (Notice that non-road dependent values like `vehicles` does NOT vary by road but remains constant across all roadtypes.) So, total CO2e emissions from urban unrestricted roads in Tompkins County in 2020 would be in the row where `by == 15`, `roadtype == 5`, `year == 2020`, `geoid == 36109`, and `pollutant == 98`. |

### 3.4 subtype identifiers

Each row has 4 subtype identifiers, describing whether the `emissions` and other metrics reported are measured ***overall*** for that `geoid-year-pollutant` set or measured for a specific `sourcetype`, `regclass`, `fueltype`, and/or `roadtype`. Each specific subtype has a unique ID code, originating from MOVES. If all 4 dissagregation identifiers are `NA`, it means it's measured overall and *not* disaggregated. For the complete list of `ids` outputted by MOVES, see the [**MOVES Onroad Cheatsheet**](moves_cheatsheet_onroad.pdf), also shown below the table.

| field        |  type    |  meaning                   | example                                                                 |
|:---          |  :---:   | :---                       |   :---                                                                  |
| `sourcetype` | integer  | unique vehicle type id     |  passenger cars is `sourcetype == 21`.                                  |
| `regclass`   | integer  | unique regulatory class id | light duty vehicles is `regclass == 20`.                                |
| `fueltype`  | integer   | unique fuel type id        | diesel is `fueltype == 2`                                               |
| `roadtype`  | integer   | unique road type id        | urban unrestricted access roads (eg. trucks allowed) is `roadtype == 5` |

### 3.5 metrics

Finally, each unique set of identifiers above contains its own metrics! Every row contains 9 metrics of interest. These include `emissions`, plus 8 activity metrics. (Although not all counties have all; MOVES can't estimate idling or hotelling for counties without much long-haul truck activity). 

| field        |  type    |  units  | meaning                             |
|:---          |  :---:   | :---    |:---                                    |
| `emissions` | double   | US tons | total annual onroad *emissions*, for whatever pollutant is selected  |
| `vmt`       | double   | miles | total annual onroad *vehicle miles traveled* |
| `vehicles` | double | vehicles | total annual *vehicles* onroad in that county |
| `starts` | double | times | total annual times vehicles were started (ignitions) |
| `sourcehours` | double | hours | total annual hours vehicles were in operation onroad |
| `idlehours`  | double | hours | total annual hours trucks spent idling. Only applies to a few categories of large combo trucks (I believe). Locations without these trucks will have a value of `NA`. |
| `hoteld` | double | hours | total annual hours trucks spent 'hotelling', doing [mandatory rest breaks](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-01/documents/hoteling-hrs-moves.pdf), using *Diesel Auxiliary Power*. |
| `hotelb` | double | hours | total annual hours trucks spent 'hotelling' doing [mandatory rest breaks](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-01/documents/hoteling-hrs-moves.pdf),  using *Battery or AC*. |
| `hotelo` | double | hours | total annual hours trucks spent 'hotelling', doing [mandatory rest breaks](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-01/documents/hoteling-hrs-moves.pdf), when *All Engines Off*. |
